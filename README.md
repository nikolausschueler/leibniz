What is it?
===========

A little demo that computes PI using the Leibniz series.

One usage example is to run his on an old tablet and enjoy how the series slowly
converges to PI. With time more and more digits stay fixed.

The Leibniz series actually converges to PI quite slowly, so it is well suited
for this purpose.

Installation
============

No installation needed. Just open the page _index.html_ in your browser.

Note that this only works from a clone of the repo. If you click the page on
GitHub, you get GitHub's display of the page, not the page itself.
